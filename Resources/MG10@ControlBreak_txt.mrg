===============================================================================
This shows how to print header/detail kind of data. 

There are two REPEAT blocks, one inside the other. The first
block is used by the parent task, which contains the tag table for 
 Seq, Title, FirstName and LastName.
 
 The inner block has tags that are referenced by the child task:
   Seq2, PhoneType, Phone.
