<!$MGIF_PrintComments>
===============================================================================
This is a generic template that is used to set up the tags for the merge
programs. It contains all the tabs, which makes it easy to set up the Tag table.

Note that the templates used at runtime to not need to use all these tags. 

Also note that there are several "Print comments" tags ... tags are not
allowed to be used twice, so if you need to use one variable to print
data in several places, you need to create several tokens that are linked
to one variable
