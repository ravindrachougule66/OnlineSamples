===============================================================================
This shows how to print header/detail kind of data. 

There are three REPEAT blocks. The first
block is used by the parent task, which contains the tag table for 
 Seq, Title, FirstName and LastName.
 
 The inner block has tags that are referenced by the child task:
   Seq2, PhoneType, Phone.
   
  The second inner block has tags that are referenced by yet another task:
   Addr1 and Addr2.
